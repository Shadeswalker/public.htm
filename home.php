					<img src="http://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2015/01/07/16/12/distillery-barrels-591602_640.jpg" alt="attraction's image" class="attraction_image"/>
					<p>Enter the mysterious World of Scotch Whisky and join Jim Barley as he takes you on the journey from fields of corn to intoxicating liquid in a glass.  On the tour you'll learn all about the mystical process as you proceed through the vintage distillery, getting an up-close view of the malting barn, the tun room, and experience the dizziness resulting from breathing the carbon dioxide created in the traditional wooden wash backs.  Following that you'll be amazed watching the wort boiled in the wash still, with the alcoholic vapors condensed in the worm coil, before being vaporized once again in the spirit still and stored in casks where it hibernate for many years, patiently waiting for the perfect time to emerge as the beautiful, light, and floral McBarely Distillery Single Malt.</p>

					<p>Don’t miss the opportunity to visit the home of the one-of-a-kind Oil Drum carbonated drink.  The tour starts in the visitors’ centre, with a fascinating presentation detailing the history of this wonderful beverage, from its origins as a craft soft drink in the 1900’s through to its current status as a world-renowned beverage.  The following factory route is a real treat: you’ll see all the stages of production including the large, oil drum-inspired vats where fresh burn water is combined with extract of fusel and crude, before being left to ferment and combined with a unique combination of gases that produce that characteristic fizzzz.  When ready, you’ll then visit the state-of-the-art automated bottling line, where, if you’re lucky, you’ll have the opportunity to cap and label a few bottles yourself.  The tour ends in the refreshment and replenishment room, where you can sample the drink and stock up on supplies for your journey home.</p>

				<h3>KeepSake Abandoned Cottages</h3>
				<div>
					<img src="http://pixabay.com/static/uploads/photo/2013/11/12/16/20/hut-209466_640.jpg" alt="attraction's image" class="attraction_image"/>
					<p>Prepare for a truly unique experience: located on a beautiful bay facing the North Sea, KeepSake Cottages was once a thriving small village inhabited by hardy souls.  Former residents were completely self-sufficient, demonstrating a model of sustainable living that many try to emulate today.  Being located on the coast allowed frequent fishing trips to catch dinner.  When supply was abundant, spare fish were preserved with salt extracted from the sea itself.  The keen-eyed visitor can still see the ridges, or run rigs, in the land surrounding the cottages where once vegetables were cultivated.  Manure was acquired from cattle and sheep farmed in the surrounding fields.  The last residents finally left the village in the 1980s, when the continual cold winds finally made modern, central heated housing more attractive.  The estate has been maintained since, allowing visitors today to get a sense of how hard life must have been eking out a meager living on the barren, windswept bay.</p>

					<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5073/5909752823_f28183b322_z_d.jpg" alt="attraction's image" class="attraction_image"/>
					<p>The distinct shape of ChillTop Mountain is a feature that’s meant ‘cold' for thousands of years. There have been inhabitants in a caves carved into the mountaintop for decades, gathering their nutrition from framing settlements on its slopes. People quarried the granite, creating blocks to raise houses, and told stories of daemons and giants who built the track around the foot of the hill or played football with the giant boulders.<br/>
					The ChillTop Mountain Centre is the ideal place to start exploring this much-loved area and the surrounding forests. The trails vary from gentle paths around the woodland to demanding hikes to the top.  The visitor center will provide you with historical details of the area, walking maps, wildlife you may encounter, and a warm cup of tea.</p>

				<h3>Loch Lopond</h3>
				<div>

					<p>The world famous Loch Lopond is the largest volume of freshwater in Scotland. Green mountains rise above to the west, and several small islands are located at the east end of the loch. Picturesque villages are located along the loch’s southern shores, providing numerous opportunities for breath-taking photographs, shopping, and dining.  The loch is part of the regional Lopond Park, where you'll find the perfect habitat for a diverse range of wildlife. Birds of pray can be seen in the forests from the mating season of the spring months through the summer when they are often spotted hunting over various lochs.  In the woodland below, herds of male or female deer roam as they feed on the grass, berries, young shoots and tree bark. During the autumn, be careful to avoid getting caught up in the spectacle of the 'rut' when the males aggressively lock antlers to win the right to mate.  With a range of water sports on offer on the lochs, wildlife spotting, and extensive walks available, there is something for everybody to enjoy at Loch Lopond.</p>
