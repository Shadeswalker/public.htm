				<th>McTree’s Highland Homes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>McTree’s Highland Homes are the proud owners, curators, and ghost hunters of historical homes in glens, towns, and cities all over Scotland.  
				Their dedicated team of highly skilled professionals has centuries of collective experience and hard work ensuring these great buildings remain standing for the benefit of future generations.  
				Many of the homes have been restored to their original conditions, allowing the visitor to experience the splendor, or in some cases squalor, that the previous inhabitants used to enjoy.  
				Just remember, few historical houses feature central heating, so if the sun is not shining, it may be a bit cool inside.  The current portfolio consists of two, very distinct properties, giving visitors a starkly contrasting experience of life in days gone by. 
				When visiting, remember to get your visitor card stamped at each property – visit them both and receive free entry to the next property added to expanding portfolio.</td>
